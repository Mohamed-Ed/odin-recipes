    <h2>Crispy Roast Chicken</h2>
    <p>Classic and delicious, this roast chicken recipe will shine on the table fresh</p>
    <p>from the oven, served with any side. And this oven-roasted chicken is basic</p>

        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>½ small lemon, cut into wedges</li>
        <li>½ small yellow onion, cut into wedges</li>
        <li>3 medium garlic cloves, smashed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
